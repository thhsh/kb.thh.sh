# The Intro

:material-hand-wave: Hey there! I'm [:fontawesome-solid-person-hiking: Tristan](https://thh.sh) and this site is ~~my digital garden~~  ~~my commonplace book~~  ~~my second brain~~ **Working Notes**.

## What is this?
To pull from [:octicons-link-external-16: Robb Knight's *The Intersect*](https://intersect.rknight.me/),  
> This is my personal wiki where I share everything I know about this world in form of ~~a website hosted on Digital Ocean and uploaded to Github.~~ a bunch of Markdown files rendered down to static HTML and hosted on Cloudflare Pages.

Rather than putting together a full blog and writing posts for every single thing (which means I just wouldn't actually publish anything), the better solution seems to be to put together a collection of snippets, bits, and bobs.

Also quoting [:octicons-link-external-16: Robb](https://intersect.rknight.me/),  
> A lot of the pages will just be snippets and links that I want to remember. For example, the ~~Javascript~~ page is just a few snippets of things I always need to look up, plus some interesting links.

## How does it work?

I've got a git repo of Markdown files, processed through [:simple-materialformkdocs: Material for MkDocs Insiders](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/insiders/), and then the output is dumped out to [:simple-cloudflarepages: Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.dev).

There's more about how this site is put together over in the [:octicons-gear-16: Meta section](Meta/index.md).

On the off chance you're looking for it, the source for this site is over on GitHub at [:material-github: thhsh/kb.thh.sh](https://github.com/thhsh/kb.thh.sh).

## Why "Working Notes"?
This thing is a forever-ongoing project that is never going to be finished. There isn't a final product, and most of the content is likely going to be notes about various life things, that are likely going to be useful to primarily **me**. Hence, *Working Notes*. (And, `#thanksADHD`, I can't remember a damn thing on my own, so it's also my working memory most of the time.)
